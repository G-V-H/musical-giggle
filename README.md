# Terminal Application - Term 1 Assignment 2
## **Statement of Purpose and Scope**
The intention of this program is to emulate and replicate the infamous Enigma Machine which gained its notoriety from World War 2. Originally developed by Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War 1, it was extensively deployed by the Germans during the second World War to provide cryptographic security for civilian and military purposes.

This program, named 'Enigma' in kind, will provide a way for users to encrypt and decrypt messages effectively using the same method as the original Enigma Machine. By using a (secret) starting code or key the user will be able to input a plain-text message and receive an encrypted message. Likewise, this message can then be decrypted by using the same starting key and inputting the encrypted message, receiving the original message. 

The encryption and decryption was accomplished by a series of polyalphabetic substitution ciphers. In more laymans terms, every character in any message that was input was replaced/substituted with another multiple times. However, due to a series of rotating rotors changing the character substitions there was no discernable pattern to the substitutions (leading many to think it was unbreakable).

Whilst not an exact replica of the original Enigma Machines, given the time constraints the increased complexities that were implemented for the German military were omitted as well as out-of-the-box customisability in civilian implementations, Enigma provides a great opportunity to expand my knowledgebase and further my interest in cryptology, mathematics, and algorithms. 

As the catalyst for what many call the "first" computer, the Enigma Machine, and the subsequent Bombe developed by Alan Turing to decipher its codes, is undoubtedly a hallmark achievement in computing and as a precursor to programming as we know it today makes it a captivating first project. 

Anyone with a passing interest in cryptology, history (especially World War 2), or anyone just wanting to hide their messages from others will find Enigma an interesting program.
